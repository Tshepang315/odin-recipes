    <h4>Vanilla Cream Cheese Frosting:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened</li>
        <li>¼ cup butter, softened</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons sour cream</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons McCormick Pure Vanilla Extract</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) box confectioners' sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C)
            <br>. Line 30 muffin cups with paper liners.</li>
        <li>Make cake: Mix together flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt in a medium
            <br> bowl; set aside.</li>
        <li>Beat sugar and butter in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium speed
            <br> until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Beat in eggs, one at a time.</li>
        <li>Mix in sour cream, milk, food color, and vanilla.</li>
        <li>Gradually beat in flour mixture on low speed until just blended; do not over-
            <br>beat. Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling each 2/3 full.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into a cupcake comes out
            <br> clean, about 20 minutes. Cool in the pans on a wire rack for 5 minutes. Remove
            <br> cupcakes from the pans; cool completely.</li>
        <li>While cupcakes are cooling, make frosting: Beat cream cheese, butter, sour
            <br> cream, and vanilla extract in a large bowl until light and fluffy. Gradually beat in
            <br> confectioners' sugar until smooth.</li>
        <li>Spread or pipe frosting onto cooled cupcakes.</li>
